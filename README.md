# Alexa skills
*	__Intents__: An intent represents an action that fulfils a user's spoken request. Intents can optionally have arguments called slots.
*	__Sample utterances__: A set of likely spoken phrases mapped to the intents. This should include as many representative phrases as possible.
*	__AWS Lambda__ is a compute service that lets you run code without provisioning or managing servers. AWS Lambda executes your code only when needed and scales automatically, from a few requests per day to thousands per second. You pay only for the compute time you consume - there is no charge when your code is not running. 

### Table 1
| Intent     | Sample utterances|
|------------|-------------------|
| FirstIntent | * First intent <br> * Tell me about first intent <br> * Activate first intent|
| SecondIntent| * Second intent <br> * Tell me about second intent <br> * Activate second intent|
| ThirdIntent | * Third intent <br> * Tell me about third intent <br> * Activate third intent |
